# Segment34 Mk3
A watchface for Garmin watches with a 34 Segment display

![Screenshot of the watchface](screenshot.png "Screenshot")

The watchface features the following:

- Time displayed with a 34 segment display
- Phase of the moon with graphic display
- Heartrate or Respiration rate
- Weather (conditions, temperature and windspeed)
- Sunrise/Sunset
- Date
- Notification count
- Configurable: Active minutes / Distance / Floors / Time to Recovery / VO2 Max
- Configurable: Steps / Calories / Distance
- Battery days remaining (or percentage on some watches)
- Always on mode
- Settings in the Garmin app

## Contributing (code)
This is more of a hobby project than an actively maintained project, I have limited time to review and respond to issues so response time can be long.

If you want to contribute code to this repository, please start by opening an issue and explaining what you have in mind and why. If I think it sounds like a good idea I can add you to contributors and let you open a PR. 

As memory is very limited on a watchface (especially on older devices) new features must meet a high bar:
- Useful for a large number of users
- Implemented in a performant and memory efficient manner
- Not in the way for existing users, if it changes how it looks it should probably be optional
- Fits in well with the aesthetics of the watch face

For refactorings and optimizations keep in mind that:
- I value my own understanding of the codebase, refactorings reduce this understanding and must outweigh the loss in other benefits
- Optimizations must include profiler results and memory useage
- Both optimizations and refactorings require significant testing across all supported devices

## Code Structure

### Source files (`source/`)

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Segment34App.mc` | App entry point; schedules background temporal events for OWM polling |
| `Segment34View.mc` | Core watchface rendering: update cycle, draw chain, layout, and settings |
| `Segment34WatchFaceDelegate.mc` | Handles touch/press input and routes actions to the view |
| `Segment34ServiceDelegate.mc` | Background service; triggers an OWM fetch on each temporal event |
| `OpenWeatherService.mc` | HTTP requests to OpenWeatherMap API (runs in background context) |
| `OpenWeatherServiceTest.mc` | Unit tests for OWM weather code → Garmin condition mapping |
| `DataHelper.mc` | Activity data and complications: steps, calories, heart rate, battery, etc. |
| `ValueResolver.mc` | Resolves configurable field type codes to display strings and labels |
| `WeatherDisplayHelper.mc` | Formats weather data for display (conditions, temperature, wind) |
| `WeatherStorage.mc` | Reads and writes weather cache to `Application.Storage` |
| `StoredWeather.mc` | Data class representing a weather snapshot |
| `ThemeManager.mc` | Computes the active color theme based on settings and time of day |
| `GraphRenderer.mc` | Histogram and line graph rendering (steps, calories, heart rate, etc.) |
| `SunCalc.mc` | Sunrise, sunset, dawn, and dusk calculations |
| `DateTimeUtils.mc` | Date and time utility functions |
| `FormatUtils.mc` | Number and string formatting helpers |

### Resources

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `resources/strings/strings.xml` | English strings — source of truth for all user-visible text |
| `resources/settings/properties.xml` | Settings property definitions (types, defaults) |
| `resources/settings/settings.xml` | Settings UI layout shown in the Garmin app |
| `resources/fonts/` | Custom bitmap fonts: segment clock displays, icons, moon phase, labels |
| `resources/drawables/` | Images and drawable definitions (launcher icon, AOD overlays) |
| `resources-{deu,fre,ita,pol,spa,swe}/` | Translated strings for 6 languages; must stay in sync with English |
